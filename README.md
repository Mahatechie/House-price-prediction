# 🏠 House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project predicts house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms using a simple Linear Regression model.

## 📌 Objective
Build a regression model to estimate the price of a house using real estate data.

## 📊 Dataset
Used a synthetic dataset with features:
- Square Footage
- Number of Bedrooms
- Number of Bathrooms
- House Price

You can also use the Kaggle dataset: [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## ✅ Steps Involved
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Linear Regression Model Training
4. Model Evaluation (R² Score, RMSE)
5. Prediction & Visualization

## 📈 Results
The model predicts house prices based on input features with decent accuracy using Linear Regression.

## 📦 Dependencies
